DATA PROCESSING

Started off with exploring the raw dataset. Although clean, several issues remained that made it hard to process efficiently
- High number of null values recorded inconsistently as "n.a." or "-"
- Redundant rows that were meant to be headers for easy viewing but affects data processing
- Lots of derived data: such as ratios that can be easily calculated, not very helpful for analysing info such as correlation etc
- Format of headers hard contains characters that caused problems for dataframe in pandas

Steps
1) For Exploratory Data Analysis, i removed all data that were ratios
2) Sieved out only the data that were highlighted in blue as the header of the catergory
3) Ended up with file EDA.xlxs
