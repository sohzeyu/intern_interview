DATA PROCESSING

Started off with exploring the raw dataset. Although clean, several issues remained that made it hard to process efficiently
- High number of null values recorded inconsistently as "n.a." or "-"
- Redundant rows that were meant to be headers for easy viewing but affects data processing
- Lots of derived data: such as ratios that can be easily calculated, not very helpful for analysing info such as correlation etc
- Format of headers hard contains characters that caused problems for dataframe in pandas

Steps
1) For Exploratory Data Analysis, i removed all data that were ratios
2) Sieved out only the data that were highlighted in blue as the header of the catergory
3) Ended up with file EDA.xlxs 
[+] Revenue
[+] Cost of Revenue
[+] Gross Profit
[+] Share Of Profit Of Associates
[+] Profit Before Tax (Include Exceptional Items)
[+] Profit After Tax
[+] Net Earnings
[+] Profit Attributable To Shareholders
[+] Shareholders' Equity
[+] Total Equity, MI & Liabilities
[+] Total Assets
[+] Operating Cash Flows Before Working Capital Changes
[+] Cash Generated From / (Used In) Operations
[+] Net Cash Generated From / (Used In) Operating Activities
[+] Net Changes In Cash And Cash Equivalents
[+] Cash And Cash Equivalents At End


Coding
- used Pandas and tried to process the data
- encountered several issues
 1) xlxs format causing issues (changed to csv)
 2) Headers and columms flipped in dataframe (edited the csv file to transpose the data)
 3) Type of data caused it to be unable to load information (changed excel sheet formatting)
 4) Some maps refused to load (bubble diagram)
- Sucessfully plotted some graphs (cat and whisker diagram)
- Sucessfully plotted some graphs (general graph)
- libraries failed to load scatterplot and bubble plot

General inference
- although most statistics hover around the same values, Revenue and Profit steadily increased throughout the years
- this was at the expense of operating cash flow in a glance, which dropped heavily
- however correlation does not mean causation, and more have to be done to determine any validity or interesting findings
